                <h1>About Me:</h1>
                <p>Hey there! I'm SHAIKH RAEES AHMAD IQBAL AHMAD, a passionate IT engineer specializing in full-stack development. I earned my Bachelor of Technology degree from GH Raisoni Institute of Business Management and Engineering college in Jalgaon, where I cultivated a strong foundation in computer science and engineering.

                    My journey into the world of technology began with a fascination for problem-solving and a love for coding. Throughout my academic and professional endeavors, I've had the opportunity to dive deep into various aspects of software development, from front-end interfaces to back-end systems.
                    
                    
                    
                   
                    
                    
                    
        
                    
                    Thank you for taking the time to learn more about me. I invite you to explore my portfolio and connect with me to discuss how we can collaborate on your next project...</p>
